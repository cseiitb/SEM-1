\item[7.]{\bf Two observers A and B, sitting at the origin of their respective inertial frames are moving with respect to each other with a relative speed of 0.6c. The observer A sends a light signal to observer B, $3\times10^{-6}$s after B passes A, as measured in A's frame. The observer B receives this light signal, He waits for $2\times10^{-6}$s after receiving the light signal as per his watch and then sends a light signal back to A.}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item {\bf Find the time when the light signal is received by B as per the watches of A and B.}
\item {\bf Find the time when the light signal is received back by A as per the watches of A and B.}
\item {\bf What was the distance of B from A when B had sent the light signal according to A and B?}
\item {\bf What was the time taken by light to reach A after it was emitted from B, according to A and B?}
\end{enumerate}

{\underline {\bf Solution}} : \\
Relative speed, v=0.6c. Hence $\gamma$=1.25. \\
The following events can be identified in the above problem :
	
{\bf E1 :} A sends light signal.\\
{\bf E2 :} B receives light signal.\\
{\bf E3 :} B sends light signal.\\
{\bf E4 :} A receives light signal.
	
Let ($x_{1}$, $t_{1}$), ($x_{2}$, $t_{2}$), ($x_{3}$, $t_{3}$) and ($x_{4}$, $t_{4}$) be the coordinates of the events in A's frame.\\
Similarly, let ($x_{1}'$, $t_{1}'$), ($x_{2}'$, $t_{2}'$), ($x_{3}'$, $t_{3}'$) and ($x_{4}'$, $t_{4}'$) be the corresponding coordinates in B's frame.\\
\\
Now, we find all unknown values, one event at a time. \\
\\
{\underline {\bf E1}}:\\
$x_{1} = 0$ \hfill(A is at origin of $1^{st}$ frame)\\
$t_{1} = 3\times10^{-6}s$ \hfill(from given data)\\
$x_{1}' = \gamma (x_{1}-vt_{1}) = -675m$ \\
$t_{1}' = \gamma (t_{1} - \frac{vx_{1}}{c^{2}}) = 3.75\times10^{-6}s$ \\
\\
{\underline {\bf E2}}:\\
$x_{2}' = 0$ \hfill(B is at origin of $2^{nd}$ frame)\\
$t_{2}' = t_{1}' + \frac{|{x_{1}'}|}{c} = 6\times10^{-6}s$ \hfill (Light was emitted at a distance $|{x_{1}'|}$ away and travelled at speed c)\\
$x_{2} = \gamma (x_{2}' + vt_{2}') = 1350m$ \\
$t_{2} = \gamma (t_{2}' + \frac{vx_{2}'}{c^{2}}) = 7.5\times10^{-6}s$ \\
\\
{\underline {\bf E3}}:\\
$x_{3}' = 0$ \hfill(B is at origin of $2^{nd}$ frame)\\
$t_{3}' = t_{2}' + 2\times10^{-6}s = 8\times10^{-6}s$ \hfill(wait-time of $2\times10^{-6}s$ between receiving and sending)
$x_{3} = \gamma (x_{3}' + vt_{3}') = 1800m$ \\
$t_{3} = \gamma (t_{3}' + \frac{vx_{3}'}{c^{2}}) = 10\times10^{-6}s$ \\
\\
{\underline {\bf E4}}:\\
$x_{4} = 0$ \hfill(A is at origin of $1^{st}$ frame)\\
$t_{4} = t_{3} + \frac{|{x_{3}}|}{c} = 16\times10^{-6}s$ \hfill (Light was emitted at $|{x_{3}|}$ distance away at time $t_{3}$ and moved at speed c)\\
$x_{4}' = \gamma (x_{4}-vt_{4}) = -3600m$ \\
$t_{4}' = \gamma (t_{4} - \frac{vx_{4}}{c^{2}}) = 20\times10^{-6}s$ \\
\\
So, the solutions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Time when the light signal is received by B as per the watch of A = $t_{2} = 7.5\times10^{-6}s$\\
Time when the light signal is received by B as per the watch of B = $t_{2}' = 6\times10^{-6}s$\\
\item Time when the light signal is received back by A as per the watch of A = $t_{4} = 16\times10^{-6}s$\\
Time when the light signal is received back by A as per the watch of B = $t_{4}' = 20\times10^{-6}s$\\
\item Distance of B from A when B had sent the light signal according to A = $x_{3} = 1800m$\\
Distance of B from A when B had sent the light signal according to B = $vt_{3}' = 1440m$\\
\item Time taken by light to reach A after it was emitted from B, according to A = $t_{4}-t_{3} = 6\times10^{-6}s$\\
Time taken by light to reach A after it was emitted from B, according to B = $t_{4}'-t_{3}' = 12\times10^{-6}s$\\
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
