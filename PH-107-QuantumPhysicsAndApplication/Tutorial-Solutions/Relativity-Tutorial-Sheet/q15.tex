\item[15.]{\bf A particle of rest mass $m_{0}$ has energy $4m_{0}c^{2}$. Find the momentum in the units of $m_{0}c$. What is the energy of the particle in a frame in which its momentum is $2m_{0}c$?}\\

{\underline {\bf Solution}} : \\
We have the relation :
\begin{center}
$E^{2}=p^{2}c^{2}+m_{0}^{2}c^{4}$\\
where E = energy of particle as observed in given frame, \\
p = momentum of particle as observed in same frame\\
\end{center}
Putting $E=4m_{0}c^{2}$, we get $16m_{0}^{2}c^{4}=p^{2}c^{2}+m_{0}^{2}c^{4}$, solving which we obtain $p=\sqrt{15}m_{0}c$. \\
\\
In a frame where observed momentum is $2m_{0}c$, we get \\
\\
$E^{2}=4m_{0}^{2}c^{4}+m_{0}^{2}c^{4}=5m_{0}^{2}c^{4}$\\
Hence, $E=\sqrt{5}m_{0}c^{2}$.
